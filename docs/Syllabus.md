## Course Description

This is an intermediate to advanced JavaScript course focused on learning how to created web applications with React. The first part of the course will get students comfortable with the basics in React. It will introduce the concepts of components, props and state. Next, students will learn how handle data from a back-end or another source with AJAX in React. Then we will teach how to build navigation with client-side routing, the signin process and how to protect private content on the front-end.

This course will also introduce you to the tools and practice of the trade. This includes working with command line, package management, version control with git, unit testing, and Scrum methodology. We usually have guest speakers from local software development firms. This class will give you an opportunity to meet employers and contacts within the capital region and beyond.
